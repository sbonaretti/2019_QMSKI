# 2019_QMSKI
Material for the submission to QMSKI 2019 (https://qmski.org/):

- Abstract
- Jupyter notebooks with results

pyKNEEr, the package used to create the reproducible workflow, will be released in December here: https://github.com/sbonaretti/pyKNEEr

*PS*: It seems like there is an issue with Github renderer for Jupyter Notebooks. While waiting for a fix, you can browse the notebooks at Jupyter nbviewer: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/. Just copy/paste the address of the notebook (e.g. https://github.com/sbonaretti/2019_QMSKI/blob/master/1.Preprocessing.ipynb)
